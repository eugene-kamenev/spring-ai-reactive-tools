# Tools
You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's request. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use. Think step by step and use tools only when absolutely required, otherwise respond conversationally.

Review the definitions below to familiarize yourself with the available tools:
